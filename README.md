## INSTALLATION

```
npm i fl-stencil-cli -g
```

## USAGE

  - ```
      flcli project [PROJECT_NAME]
    ```
- **TO CREATE A PAGE (you need to be inside a fl-project)**:
  - ```
      flcli page [PAGE_NAME]
    ```
- **TO CREATE A MOLECULE (you need to be inside a fl-project)**:

## COMPONENTS

Initial components generated by the cli are:

- **APP**: App starter component, it contains the Routing structure of your application and it's the component you need to include inside the **index.html** file.
- **MARKDOWN-READER**: This component is needed to visualize the readme of the molecule/page, its route is

```
../md-reader?id=[FILE_NAME_OF_COMPONENT]
```

You can also create those components type:

- **PAGES**: Pages are the main components of the application, they contain the semantically correct structure you should have in the HTML for a page: **body -> header, body -> main -> section**. Those components can be generated using

```node
    flcli page page-name
```

- **MOLECULES**: Those are the standalone components that will accept **@Props and @Events**, they shouldn't have the main logic but they should output someething readable by the father. They have this nomenclature [PREFIX_YOU_CHOOSED_AT_START]-[NAME]-molecule. Those components can be generated using

```node
    flcli molecule molecule-name
```

## SCRIPTS

Those are the scripts available inside the project:

- **`npm start`**: this script start the app in his localhost (starting at **localhost:3333**) and it could be used with this modifier: **env=envName** to choose inside the envs folder which env is used while starting the app.
  You can use those evolution:

```node
    npm run start-dev /* equivalent of npm start env=dev */
    npm run start-prod /* equivalent of npm start env=prod */
```

- **`npm run build`**: this script build your components in the distribution folder (**./dist**), it could be used with this modifier: **env=envName** to choose inside the envs folder which env is used while starting the app.
  You can use those evolution:

```node
    npm run build-dev /* equivalent of npm run start-dev compile */
    npm run build-prod /* equivalent of npm run start-prod compile */
```

- **`npm run readme`**: This script compile the auto-readme of your components keeping the precedent one you already wrote. to recompile the default readme just delete the current one and run this script

## ENVIRONMENTS

You can use every environm ent you want, just create an env file inside **./src/envs** folder with this nomenclature `env.**[ENV_NAME]**.ts`. You can access to the file importing:

```js
import { Environment } from '@env';
```

after that remember to launch the start or build script with:

```node
npm run start/build env=[ENV_NAME]
```

## STORYBOOK

Storybook is implemented by default, you can write your own stories inside each molecule, they should keep the suffix `*.stories.js`.
By default only the molecule folder is red, you can change it by modifying the `stories-compiler.js` file by adding your own patterns:

```js
const patterns = [
  `${__dirname}${pathDivider}..${pathDivider}src${pathDivider}components${pathDivider}molecules${pathDivider}**${pathDivider}*.stories.js`
];
```

To launch storybook you have to run these two scripts (in two instances of terminal):

- `npm run build-for-storybook`
- `npm run storybook`

You can wrap the using [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)
Stencil can use only Storybook for HTML version, so you won't write in JSX but you will write in plain JS.

## DISTRIBUTION (aka dist)

Inside **`dist`** folder you have your minified components for your ui-library (ready to publish on npm), build with `npm run build/build-[ENV]`.

## PARALLEL BUILDS (aka builds/[BUILD-NAME])

Inside **`builds/[BUILD-NAME]`** folder you will find the parallel builds you defined inside the `fl-stencil-config.json` to have the builds (ready to be published inside npm) you should run `npm run build-prod-dupes`, you can configure the builds you want inside the configuration JSON, these builds let you create differents package of your application removing components/folder or modifying files in your current project. Use the templates folder to re/write a file for your different builds.

## PUBLISHING (aka www)

Inside **`www`** folder you have your minified website ready for production, build with `npm run build/build-[ENV]`.

## TESTING

You can use the **Unit** or **e2e** as [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/testing-overview) allows. the **.spec** and **.e2e** files are automatically generated by the flcli scripts, obviusly you can edit them as you want, at the start of the project you can choose which one to include.
