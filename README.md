# FLOWROME STENCIL CLI 

<a href="https://d3js.org"><img src="./images/logo-bw-little.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a> This project is a CLI to create your own web-components library project using [Web-Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/), [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), [Stencil/router](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-router) , [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [JSX](https://it.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

Flowrome Stencil CLI is used to create a scaffold that contains the structure to build your own web-components library using Stencil

## INSTALLATION
```
git clone https://Flowrome@bitbucket.org/Flowrome/fl-stencil-cli.git
npm i -g /path/to/fl-stencil-cli/
```

## USAGE
* **TO CREATE PROJECT SCAFFOLD**:
    - ```
        flcli project [PROJECT_NAME]
        ```
* **TO CREATE A PAGE (you need to be inside a fl-project)**:
    - ```
        flcli page [PAGE_NAME]
        ```
* **TO CREATE A MOLECULE (you need to be inside a fl-project)**:
    - ```
        flcli molecule [MOLECULE_NAME]
        ```

## COMPONENTS
Initial components generated by the cli are:
* **APP**: App starter component, it contains the Routing structure of your application and it's the component you need to include inside the **index.html** file.
* **MARKDOWN-READER**: This component is needed to visualize the readme of the molecule/page, its route is 
```
../md-reader?id=componentID
```
* **PAGES**: Pages are the main components of the application, they contain the semantically correct structure you should have in the HTML for a page: **body -> header, body -> main -> section**. Those components can be generated using
```node
    flcli page page-name
```
* **MOLECULES**: Those are the standalone components that will accept **@Props and @Events**, they shouldn't have the main logic but they should output someething readable by the father. They have this nomenclature [PREFIX_YOU_CHOOSED_AT_START]-[NAME]-molecule. Those components can be generated using
```node
    flcli molecule molecule-name
```

## SCRIPTS
Those are the scripts available inside the project:
* **``` npm start ```**: this script start the app in his localhost (starting at **localhost:3333**) and it could be used with this modifier: **env=envName** to choose inside the envs folder which env is used while starting the app.
You can use those evolution: 
```node 
    npm run start-dev /* equivalent of npm start env=dev */
    npm run start-prod /* equivalent of npm start env=prod */
```
* **``` npm run build ```**: this scrit build your components in the distribution folder (**./dist**), it could be used with this modifier: **env=envName** to choose inside the envs folder which env is used while starting the app.
You can use those evolution: 
```node 
    npm run build-dev /* equivalent of npm run start-dev compile */
    npm run build-prod /* equivalent of npm run start-prod compile */
```
* **``` npm run readme ```**: This script compile the auto-readme of your components keeping the precedent one you already wrote. to recompile the default readme just delete the current one and run this script

## ENVIRONMENTS
You can use every environment you want, just create an env file inside **./src/envs** folder with this nomenclature env.**[ENV_NAME]**.ts. You can access to the file importing:
``` js
import { Environment } from '@env';
```
after that remember to launch the start or build script with:
```node 
npm run start/build env=[ENV_NAME]
```

## TESTING 
You can use the **Unit** or **e2e** as [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/testing-overview) allows. the **.spec** and **.e2e** files are automatically generated by the flcli scripts, obviusly you can edit them as you want.
